In the silence of the night I roam,
Through dreams and stars, I find my home.
Whispers echo in the moonlit sky,
As memories dance and questions fly.

Soft winds carry a song so old,
Of hearts once warm, now quiet and cold.
In shadows deep, where secrets lie,
I chase the past and wonder why.

A lonely path, yet hope still burns,
For every soul, a day returns.
The dawn will rise, the dark will fade,
And light shall heal the wounds we made.
